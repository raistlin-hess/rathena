// How often should a monster rethink its chase?
// 0: Every 100ms (MIN_MOBTHINKTIME)
// 1: Every cell moved
// 2: Every 2 cells moved
// 3: Every 3 cells moved (official)
// x: Every x cells moved
// Regardless of this setting, a monster will always rethink its chase if it has 
// reached its target. Increase this value if you want to make monsters continue
// moving after they lost their target (hide, no line of sight, etc.).
